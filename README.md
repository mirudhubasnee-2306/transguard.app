# project name:
 Transguard- blockchain based transport documentation app 
# project description:
  To develop an application that secures and verifies the documents using a decentralized platform.The use of blockchain technology makes sure that the uploaded documents are tamper-proof,transparent and highly secured.
  The main purpose of introducing block chain is because the datas here are given as blocks of chain so the datas are not accessed entirely by single entity .This reduces the risk of data theft.
 # Key Features:
  Decentralization: Powered by blockchain, the system operates without a central server, distributing data across a peer-to-peer network for improved security and transparency.
  Immutable Records: Documentation such as vehicle licenses, registrations, and maintenance histories are permanently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity and preventing fraud.
  Transparent Information Sharing: Users can securely share verified documents with third parties (e.g., authorities, service providers) in real time.
  Smart Contracts: Automates certain operations, such as license renewals and record updates, ensuring timely and reliable processes.
  User-Friendly Interface: Simple, intuitive interface for managing transport documents on mobile and web platforms.
  Privacy & Security: Only authorized users can view or edit documentation, ensuring that private information is securely stored and shared.
 # Technologies Used:
  Blockchain: For secure, decentralized data storage.
  Smart Contracts: Written in Solidity for automated document verification and updates.
  Frontend: Flutter for mobile app development or React for web.
  Backend: Node.js or another backend framework for APIs.
  IPFS: (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized file storage.
  Cryptography: For secure data sharing and user authentication.
